This ROS (Robot Operating System) package consists of 4 nodes working together to create every 15 seconds random points. A cubic trajectory connecting the points is then calculated and plotted. 
The code has been implemented in Python. A launch file has been created such that all four nodes can be started by a single command. This code was developed during the Advanced Robotic System module.
